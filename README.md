# Platform Ticket Project

## Introduction

The Platform Ticket Project was intended to teach how to replicate an old "Platform Ticket" to the November 12th, 1895 New Metropolitan Opera House event using HTML and CSS (Sass). There are many fonts in the original ticket, from what I can tell there is at least 8 fonts if not more. While I am including the New Metropolitan Opera House logo in the top as a font, for this project I instead used a svg of that logo.

While working on this project I used a few fonts that I found similar to the original fonts used and tried to recreate the appearence of the ticket. Some ways that I was able to somewhat recreate the original ticket's appearence was by using different fonts (some being variable fonts) and with css like font-weight, font-variation-caps, transform: scale();, and even with some variable font settings.

Inspiration for how to recreate this ticket came from Olivia Ng's [Train Ticket Codepen](https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/MZZYyO)
